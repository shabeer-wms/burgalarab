  - "Payment Completed" and "Cancel" buttons

#### 2. BillingPayments Component (`src/components/staff/BillingPayments.tsx`)

### Technical Details

#### Dependencies
- `qrcode.react` - For generating fallback QR codes
- QR code image stored in `/public/upi-qr-code.jpg`

#### State Management
- `showUpiQrModal` - Controls visibility of UPI QR modal
- Modal has z-index of 60 to appear above payment method dialog (z-index 50)

#### Payment Processing
- UPI payment follows same flow as other payment methods
- After "Payment Completed" is clicked, it calls the existing `processPayment('upi')` or `generateBill()` functions
- No changes to backend/database logic required

### Files Modified

### Styling
- Modal uses existing Tailwind CSS classes
- Responsive design with proper spacing
- Clear visual hierarchy with:
  - Blue background for instructions
  - Primary color highlight for amount
  - Border around QR code for emphasis

### Future Enhancements
- Add payment verification status
- Add timer for payment timeout
- Add copy-to-clipboard for UPI ID
- Add support for multiple UPI IDs
- Add payment confirmation from UPI gateway (if integration available)

## Testing
1. Login as waiter
2. Create new order with items
3. Click "Send to Kitchen" â†’ "Pay Now"
4. Select UPI payment method
5. Verify QR code modal appears with correct information
6. Test "Payment Completed" and "Cancel" buttons

## Screenshots Location
The QR code image is located at:
- **File Path**: `c:\Users\HP\Desktop\restaurent-managent-5\public\upi-qr-code.jpg`
- **URL in App**: `/upi-qr-code.jpg`

## Notes
- QR code includes UPI payment URL format: `upi://pay?pa=sayedshahloobp-1@oksbi&pn=Restaurant&cu=OMR`

- Modal prevents accidental closure during payment processing
